Tanks - made by Mason Jones and Francesco Romano

The objective of the game is to shoot the other player before they shoot you.  
Missiles ricochet off of walls, but do not have indefinite range.  

Controls are as follows:

Player 1	Action			Player 2
W		Move up			Up
A		Move left		Left
S		Move down		Down
D		Move right		Right

Q		Turn counterclockwise	Slash
E		Turn clockwise		Shift

Space		Fire			Period

To start the game, run Main.java and click the start button.

In addition to the game itself, there is also a program to create custom maps
for the game.  To create a map, click the 'Create Map' button and fill in the squares that
you want to set as walls.  To go back to the default map, delete Background.jpg
